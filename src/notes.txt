containers
have size in px
needs starting ratio/size

zones
read/compare to size of container
has size in px
no starting size

window resize:
update container first, then zone?
have container css be %, so it would auto update as the window changes size
but would still need to check the total size against the new window size... or just keep checking its own rect
what if container size was an object and that's linked to the zones
but zones need to update size as the container size changes, to be a ratio
if zones had a percentage too, could just keep using that

update zone size when container size changes
update zone percentage when zone size changes
set zone percentage when checking size --> the percentage is always the same until the zone itself changes

zones use their size in css
containers use their %

new properties:
size (for both -> size object): Size
ratio: Size {height: size % ...}

on zone mount:
update ratio after recording current size

on window resize:
update size based on stored ratio * window size --> do we need to use container size?

need actual size of container so that can compare it to how big a zone is
how to tell if the size of the zone warrants resizing the container too
if the size of the zone is bigger than the container
  WAIT
  didn't we decide not to do this
-- zone's NEVER resize container, instead there is a different lever for that
zones only resize other zones in the same container
-- different problem

resizing container
need to have detection for mouse controls somewhere -- assume it's in the middle/in between
overall container watches the event, tracks the mouse movement
  if mouse.x is increasing, first container in list gets more size, else first container shrinks
  need watcher on every outside index, except the last
  do it on the left edge, doesn't go for index=0, talks to container on the right

watcher component passes the index it was rendered on to the function
function indexes the container list at that point to get the (left, right) containers, at 
  (index - 1, index)
  and index is always > 0

then it's just normal tracking, go to left, size increase for containerPair[1], etc
try and copy out the function from widget.vue to the mixin, use same for container but ignore/don't calculate y
would make more sense to store the size so that this can be incremented easily
no point of the percentage at all really, just size with size!!!


container component watches and updates both of the container objects
zones need to watch the container size to know when to update


container sizes self with px, tracks mouse
HAS INITIAL WIDTH % ONLY -- or just define in class, size in style -- do this, closer to zones, functions same way
wait, still need to calculate size for window size change then
solution: style with %, store both % and size. update size -> % when container size is changing only, window size has no effect
zones watch parent container size
update to new size by multiplying their ratio * new container size

steps:
- add size & ratio to container
  * starting ratio can be in class for now - style will override
  remove overall size/height
  setting function for ratio + set on mount
- add ratio property to zone
  update whenever setting size, compare to parent container size
